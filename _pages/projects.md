    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include video.liquid path="https://b23.tv/oDmE2wg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include video.liquid path="https://b23.tv/ybDYQiM" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
